# PREROUTING chain
# ----------------
-A PREROUTING -m mark --mark 0x7f100000/0xfff00000 -j DNAT --to-destination %l0_ip4_addr%

# POSTROUTING chain
# -----------------
#
# 1. Allow locally originated packets to pass without SNAT.
#
# 2. Use MASQUERADE to SNAT all packets going to uplink.
#
# 3. MASQUERADE all packets going from downlink to downlink
#    if they belongs to DNATed connection.
#
#    This is needed for correct DNAT behavior when for example host from network
#    in downlink group connects to DNATed port 80, and packet would go to the
#    same network, where both hosts directly reachable: without SNAT packets from
#    DNATed host to initial host might go directly, and thus dropped because host
#    knowns nothing about them.
#
# Use MASQUERADE as it does not require source address to SNAT,
# permitting to create generic rules.
