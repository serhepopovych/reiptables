# Mark non-locally destined packets for divert/discard
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# Mark packet to specific service as eligible for divert, overwise
# mark it as eligible for discard.
#
# Mark is 32-bit integer, has following format:
#
#                 19  16
#  +--------+----+--+-+-+--------+--------+
#  |      0x7f1  |00|T|D|    divert id    |
#  +--------+----+--+-+-+--------+--------+
#   31         20   17  15     8 7      0
#
# Bits from 0 to 15 denotes id of the divert, used to apply custom rules to
# each divert (e.g.: to ratelimit incoming connections to socket, etc).
# Divert id 0 is used to match packets belonging to already established
# connection. Port numbers might be used in divert id to distinguish
# services in range from 1 (0x0001) to 65535 (0xffff).
#
# Bit 16 is (D)iscard bit. If set, then packets with such mark should
# be discarded unconditionally, regardless value, specified in divert id
# field. Discard bit mainly used in PBR to distinguish packets being
# diverted and packets, that should be discarded in forwarding path
# (see FORWARD chain setup in filter table).
#
# Bit 17 is (T)ype bit. It is set to declare that protocol whose port
# number is stored in divert id field is UDP. Otherwise it is TCP.
#
# Bits from 18 to 19 are reserved and should be zero. Rules should not
# inspect these bits.
#
# Bits from 20 to 31 denotes "prefix" of divert mark, used to distinguish
# divert mark from other marks.
#
# Packets accepted in this chain are connection tracked, and thus may be
# refragmented by nf_defrag_ipv4 if needed, before matching socket.
#
# 1. Mark packet for divert and annotate it with discard eligibility bit.
#    Further rules must clear this bit to make it accepted later on input.
#
# 2. Clear discard bit for TCP packets to 80 port and accept packet.

-A PRE-BLOCK -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x00050/0x3ffff

# Input packets destined locally
# ------------------------------
#
# 1. Accept packets received not on system loopack interface (lo) and not
#    in suppress connection tracking list.
#
# 2. Suppress connection tracking and accept packet.
#
-A PRE-LOCAL ! -i lo -m set ! --match-set pre-inp-notrack-v4 dst,dst,src -j ACCEPT
-A PRE-LOCAL -j CT --notrack

# PREROUTING chain
# ----------------
#
# 1. If packet comes from interface other than uplink, src not in bypass list and
#    uRPF checks in strict mode failed drop packet silently.
#
# 2. Process packets for local destinations.
#
# 3. If packet comes from interface other than uplink and it's source address is
#    in pre-block-v4 and destination address not in list pre-allow4blk-v4 then
#    block packet.
#
# 4. Accept packet. Suppress connection tracking if packet's source/destination
#    matches pre-fwd-notrack-v4 set. This affects packet defragmentation process:
#
#      untracked packets not defragmented by nf_defrag_ipv4 if raw_before_defrag
#      parameter of iptables_raw module is set.

# OUTPUT chain
# ------------
#
# 1. Accept packets sent not to system loopback interface (lo) and not
#    in connection tracking suppress list.
#
# 2. Suppress connection tracking and accept packet.
