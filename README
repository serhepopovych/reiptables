Re-configure iptables/ip6tables from tables template files
==========================================================

Create chains and rules from template files regardless of rules being
currently configured or not.

Template files implement generic firewall using network device groups
and ip sets to achieve maximum performance and flexibility.

Features and functionality
--------------------------

  o IPv4 and IPv6 support
  o Unicast Reverse Path Filtering (uRPF) with option to skip
  o L7 HTTP Redirect using TPROXY
  o Stateless with UNTRACKED connection, stateful firewall and NAT
  o Limiting number of tracked connections per source IP
  o Setting Traffic Control (TC) priority from ip sets on src match
  o Connection rate-limiting for SSH on port 22
  o Non-silent discard of filtered at INPUT packets by rate-limited
    per source responce send using:
     - TCP RST for TCP
     - ICMP Port Unreachable for UDP
  o Discard filtered at FORWARD packets with ICMP Admin Prohibited.

Concepts and implementation
---------------------------

Processing iptables/ip6tables rules are done linearly that has poor
impact on performance. Thus to gain acceptable performance results
number of rules should be kept at minimum that may affect flexibility.

For flexibility ip sets with hash:net,port,net tuple support and others
are used to match L3 and L4 information from packet.

To keeping number of rules constant regardless of packet flow direction
there is concept of zones (groups):

  uplink   - external networks
  downlink - internal (protected) networks

  loopback   - host interface(s), not including system lo
  management - connection to management network(s)
  sink       - blackhole egress packets, no ingress

By default connection tracking on for all (including transit) traffic
coming to or originating from the box.

To track thousands of connections hash tables are used that in case of
multiple src,dst tuples can make hash tables very large negatively
impacting performance and functionality. Maximum number of connection
tracking entries allowed in network namespace controlled with
net/nf_conntrack_max sysctl parameter. There are additional sysctl
settings that control timeout for entries that can be used to kick
outdated ones earlier.
